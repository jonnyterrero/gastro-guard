## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Structure Changes

The data structure has been enhanced to include:

```python
# New DataFrame structure
log_data = pd.DataFrame(columns=[
    "Time",              # When the entry was logged
    "Time_of_Ingestion", # When the meal was actually consumed
    "Meal",              # What was consumed
    "Pain Level",        # Pain level (0-10)
    "Stress Level",      # Stress level (0-10)
    "Remedy"             # Remedy used
])
```

### Key Functions Added

1. **`retroactive_log()`** - Handles retroactive logging in Tkinter
